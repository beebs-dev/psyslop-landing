help me think of Sora prompt ideas for my concept, PsySlop.TV, which is set in a world where everything revolves around "slop". What exactly "slop" is in this universe is never adequately defined. Sometimes it's food, sometimes it's energy, other times it's a weapon, a metaphor for rizz, etc. Musicians sing about slop, and slop is hotly debated in politics. Come up with 2-3 sentence long prompts for 10s sora videos. Lean heavily into absurd/awkward humor. Make sure to mention slop at least two times. Have characters say the catch phrase "Sloppy!". Where appropriate, include instructions to visually depict slop as a disgusting green-yellow semisolid. Give me prompts based on daytime television concepts from cable TV in the mid 2000's


USCSB-style disaster and safety analysis video on a fictional chemical process incident. This takes place at a large industrial chemical plant located inappropriately in the middle of a suburban neighborhood. The company running the chemical plant is S.L.O.P. Chemical, a division of S.L.O.P. Industries. The incident entails pressure inside of a reaction vessel containing slop (depicted as green slime) building quickly and causing a massive, volcano-like eruption of slop 500 feet into the air. The fountain of slop was reported as visible from six miles away. Thankfully, there were no fatalities or injuries. All employees it out safely before the explosion, and the narrator commends S.L.O.P. Chemical for their forward-thinking safety culture. However, the slop explosion takes out the entire plant ($1.5 billion in losses) and showers the surrounding neighborhood in thick, green slime
