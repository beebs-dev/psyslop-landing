USCSB-style disaster and safety analysis video on a fictional chemical process incident.

Chemical, a division of S.L.O.P. Industries. The incident entails pressure inside of a reaction vessel containing slop (depicted as green slime) building quickly and causing a massive, volcano-like eruption of slop 500 feet into the air.
